👩🏾‍💻 About Me
Data Analyst in the Making | Coffee Data Enthusiast | Storyteller with Numbers

I'm an aspiring data analyst currently immersed in a rigorous data analytics bootcamp, where I'm transforming raw data into actionable insights—one SQL query at a time. ☕📊

Why This Project?
This end-to-end analysis of Bright Coffee Shop’s sales is my first hands-on experience with real-world data workflows:

SQL Magic: Cleaned and transformed messy sales data in Snowflake

Visual Storytelling: Designed dashboards to reveal peak hours and top products

CEO-Ready Recommendations: Proposed data-driven strategies to boost revenue

My Mission:
To bridge the gap between data and business decisions—with clarity, creativity, and a dash of coffee-fueled passion.
