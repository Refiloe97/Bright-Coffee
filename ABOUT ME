👩🏾‍💻 About Me

I’m an aspiring data analyst currently completing a data analytics bootcamp. This is my first end-to-end data project where I applied real tools and workflows — from Snowflake SQL and data visualization to business storytelling and recommendations.
My goal is to break into tech by showcasing real, hands-on analytics projects like this one. Feedback is welcome!
