# ☕ Bright Coffee Shop Sales Analysis (BRIGHTLIGHT)



This project analyzes historical transactional data from Bright Coffee Shop to provide actionable insights to the newly appointed CEO. It represents my first full data analytics pipeline — from data planning, cleaning, and analysis to presentation and recommendation.

## 📌 Objective

Support the CEO’s strategic decisions with data by answering:

- Which products generate the most revenue?

- What time of day sees the highest sales?

- Which products underperform?

- What are the actionable steps to improve overall sales performance?
